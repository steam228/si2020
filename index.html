        The Digital Media Summer Institute is a <strong>virtual immersive 4-day event
        aimed at the collaborative development of research projects</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="mainType">
        A small  group of Ph.D. students and candidates will be selected to participate
        in this program where four leading international researchers will tutor
        them, providing guidance and valuable insights into their research. Each
        day, the program will begin with an online keynote. The keynotes are
        open to the general public, but there will be limited places, and
        previous registration is mandatory.Participants of the summer institute
        will be guaranteed a spot.
      </p>
      <p class="mainType">
        During the day, participants will have one-on-one time on a private
        session with the tutors where they will receive guidance on their
        projects. Group chats and activities with the participants will also
        take place during these 4 days. Participants (applicants should be Ph.D.
        students or candidates) will be selected according to their topics of
        research and work, and each will be assigned a tutor (each tutor will
        have 3 students under their wing).
      </p>
      <p class="mainType">
      Participants can look forward to strengthening their scientific approach
      by looking at their research from new, fresh perspectives, and by asking
      new and unconventional questions. Participants will also have the
      opportunity to build a community, share ideas, and collaborate with each
      other and with the instructors.

      <h4>Morning</h4>
<p>
Each day will begin with an exciting group talk/activity or keynote to get you pumped for the day.  After the first activity of the day, you will have time to work on your project, according to the guidelines previously given to you by your designated tutor. Somewhere during the day, you will have a one-on-one meeting with your tutor. The exact time will be agreed between you and your tutor before the event begins.
</p>

<h4>Afternoon</h4>
<p>
The afternoon will begin with a light mini-workshop (between 15-30 minutes) designed to energize you for the second half of the day. Here you will have a chance to learn and also to talk and get to know your fellow participants better.
</p>

<h4>Daycap</h4>
<p>
At the end of a productive afternoon, you will have a group meeting where we will review what we did/learn during the day, and chat a little to get to know each other better. We will also have time to relax, unwind, and have fun.
